// We are taught to learn Time Complexity
// Time complexity of merge sort is nlongn and it is the same with quicksort
// However quicksort doesn't use extra space like mergesort
// So in a sense it is better
// To calculate time complexities of these algorithms we need to first find its recurrence relations
// And solve the recurrence relations
